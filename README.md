# Sorting-Visualizer
This is a ReactJS based application that helps visualize different sorting algorithms. This project is still a work in progress as I am still trying to implement the visualizations of the different algorithms
Main feature of the app is to take user input of numbers and specific sorting algorithm. When the user click "Sort" a grid will be created illustrating each step of the sorting algorithm
